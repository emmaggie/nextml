In this tutorial, we try to tackle three practical aspects of training deep learning models: using GPUs effectively, handling moderately large datasets, classifying videos. 

We start by building an understanding of deep convolution neural networks (ConvNets) and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization. 

Then there would be a small introduction to Torch and Lua, with a walkthrough of the neural network and optimization packages. Then the session becomes completely hands-on (with instructor guidance). The data used is from the UCF Action Recognition dataset which contains videos of humans doing things like brushing their teeth, playing the flute etc.

By the end of the hands-on session, you will be able to build a deep convolutional neural network that can recognize human actions with reasonable accuracy.

The session concludes by showing how to use the same pipeline for audio classification, image classification and text classification with only a few minor changes.

The session is driven using Torch-7, Amazon EC2 GPU instances, and IPython notebooks.
